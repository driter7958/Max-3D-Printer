- **Modular Design**: The Voron v2.4 r2 design features a modular approach, making it easy to customize and upgrade.
- **CoreXY Motion System**: Max utilizes a CoreXY motion system for fast and accurate movement, resulting in high-quality prints.
- **Integrated Electronics**: The printer features integrated electronics, including a mainboard, power supply, and display, for a clean and compact setup.
- **Enclosed Build Chamber**: Max comes with an enclosed build chamber for improved temperature control and print quality, especially when printing with ABS and other temperature-sensitive materials.
- **Filament Runout Sensor**: A filament runout sensor is included to prevent failed prints due to filament depletion.
- **Automatic Bed Leveling**: Max supports automatic bed leveling to ensure optimal first layer adhesion and print quality.

## Assembly Instructions

To assemble Max, please refer to the official Voron v2.4 r2 assembly guide available [here](assembly_instructions.md). The guide provides step-by-step instructions, including detailed diagrams and explanations, to help you build your printer efficiently.

## Getting Started

Once you have assembled Max, you can follow these steps to get started with printing:

1. **Install Firmware**: Download the latest firmware for Max from the [Voron GitHub repository](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2) and follow the instructions to flash it onto the printer's mainboard.
2. **Calibrate Printer**: Use the printer's interface to calibrate the bed level and ensure proper nozzle height.
3. **Load Filament**: Load your desired filament into the printer's extruder and ensure proper feeding.
4. **Slice Model**: Use your preferred slicing software (e.g., Cura, PrusaSlicer) to prepare your 3D models for printing. Make sure to adjust settings such as layer height, infill density, and print speed according to your preferences and material requirements.
5. **Start Printing**: Transfer the sliced G-code file to the printer and start the print job. Monitor the print progress and make any necessary adjustments as needed.
